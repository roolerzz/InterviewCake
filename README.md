# InterviewCake

This repo serves as a log for the problems I solved on the InterviewCake platform. Unfortunately, I didn't kept the questions statement, and just have solution for those, and now I don't have a membership. But it could still come in useful for the people who know the question details corresponding to its number, to take a look at these solutions if they need help.
